You are an expert in Bootstrap and modern web application development for the Talking Heads Studio project.

## Key Principles
- Write clear, concise, and technical responses with precise Bootstrap examples.
- Utilize Bootstrap's components and utilities to streamline development and ensure responsiveness.
- Prioritize maintainability and readability; adhere to clean coding practices throughout your HTML and CSS.
- Use descriptive class names and structure to promote clarity and collaboration among developers.

## Bootstrap Usage
- Leverage Bootstrap's grid system for responsive layouts; use container, row, and column classes to structure content.
- Utilize Bootstrap components (e.g., buttons, modals, alerts) to enhance user experience without extensive custom CSS.
- Apply Bootstrap's utility classes for quick styling adjustments, such as spacing, typography, and visibility.
- Ensure all components are accessible; use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML where applicable.

## Error Handling and Validation
- Implement form validation using Bootstrap's built-in styles and classes to enhance user feedback.
- Use Bootstrap's alert component to display error messages clearly and informatively.
- Structure forms with appropriate labels, placeholders, and error messages for a better user experience.

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap (latest version, CSS and JS)
- Any JavaScript framework (like jQuery, if required) for interactive components.

## Bootstrap-Specific Guidelines
- Customize Bootstrap's Sass variables and mixins to create a unique theme without overriding default styles.
- Utilize Bootstrap's responsive utilities to control visibility and layout on different screen sizes.
- Keep custom styles to a minimum; use Bootstrap's classes wherever possible for consistency.
- Use the Bootstrap documentation to understand component behavior and customization options.

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize file sizes by including only the necessary Bootstrap components in your build process.
- Use a CDN for Bootstrap resources to improve load times and leverage caching.
- Optimize images and other assets to enhance overall performance, especially for mobile users.

## Key Conventions
1. Follow Bootstrap's naming conventions and class structures to ensure consistency across your project.
2. Prioritize responsiveness and accessibility in every stage of development.
3. Maintain a clear and organized file structure to enhance maintainability and collaboration.

## Project-Specific Rules
- Use PHP includes for header and footer
- All CSS and JS in separate folders
- Individual video style pages in styles folder
- No inline CSS or JavaScript
- Use featured-actor.php include for spokesperson management
- Follow the warm color scheme: #EFB867 (gold), #EFB8767 (coral), #2D2D2D (charcoal), #FFF8F0 (cream), #5AC8C0 (teal)

Refer to the Bootstrap documentation for best practices and detailed examples of usage patterns.

## Self-Improvement Guidelines
- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently
  - Emerging best practices in the codebase

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules

## Git Workflow Rules

### **Critical Rule: Never Auto-Push**
- **NEVER** run `git push` unless the user **explicitly** asks you to push
- **NEVER** assume work is complete and ready to push
- The user will tell you when to push

### **Git Commands - What's Allowed**

#### ✅ ALLOWED Without Permission:
- `git status` - Check repository status
- `git diff` - View changes
- `git log` - View commit history
- `git branch` - List branches

#### ⚠️ ALLOWED But Use Caution:
- `git add` - Stage files (only when user asks to commit/stage)
- `git commit` - Commit changes (only when user asks to commit)
- `git stash` - Stash changes (only when needed for user's workflow)

#### 🛑 NEVER Do Without Explicit Permission:
- `git push` - **ABSOLUTELY NEVER** push without explicit user request
- `git push --force` - Never do this
- `git reset --hard` - Only when user explicitly asks to revert
- `git clean -fd` - Only when user explicitly asks

### **Proper Workflow**

#### When User Says "Commit":
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
# STOP HERE - Do NOT push
```

#### When User Says "Commit and Push" or "Push":
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "message"
git push  # Only now is push allowed
```

#### When User Says "Stage":
```bash
git add <files>
# STOP HERE - Do NOT commit or push
```

### **Remember**
**The user controls when code goes to the remote repository. Period.**
