# CSS Sync PRD: Match talkingheadstudio.com to talkingheads.com

## Project Overview
Sync CSS styling from https://talkingheads.com/ to http://talkingheadstudio.com/index.php to achieve visual parity between the two sites.

## Objectives
1. Make the local site (talkingheadstudio.com) visually match the reference site (talkingheads.com) exactly
2. Identify and extract all missing CSS declarations from the reference site
3. Add missing CSS to css/main.css while preserving existing styles
4. Create a backup before making changes
5. Verify visual equivalence after changes

## Scope

### In Scope
- CSS analysis and comparison between local and remote sites
- Extraction of missing CSS selectors and declarations
- Adding missing CSS to css/main.css
- Creating backup file (css/main.backup.before-talkingheads-sync.css)
- Visual verification of changes

### Out of Scope
- HTML structure changes (unless absolutely necessary for pixel-perfect matching)
- JavaScript modifications
- Image or asset replacements
- Content changes

## Technical Requirements

### Analysis Phase
1. Inspect local project:
   - Analyze index.php structure
   - Identify all CSS files linked (css/main.css, css/plugins.css, etc.)
   - Document CSS load order
   - Map HTML structure, classes, and IDs

2. Inspect remote reference site:
   - Fetch and analyze HTML from https://talkingheads.com/
   - Identify all CSS files used (including cached/minified files)
   - Document CSS load order
   - Map HTML structure, classes, and IDs
   - Extract all CSS rules that affect the main page

3. Compare structures:
   - Compare DOM structure between local and remote
   - Identify class/ID differences that could affect styling
   - Note structural differences in header, navigation, hero, content, footer

### CSS Diffing Phase
1. For each CSS file used by talkingheads.com:
   - Extract all selectors and declarations used on the main page
   - Compare against local CSS (css/main.css and other linked files)
   - Identify missing selectors
   - Identify missing declarations within existing selectors

2. Prioritize above-the-fold elements:
   - Header and navigation styling
   - Hero section styling
   - Main content area styling
   - Footer styling

### Implementation Phase
1. Create backup:
   - Copy css/main.css to css/main.backup.before-talkingheads-sync.css

2. Add missing CSS:
   - Add all missing selectors/declarations to css/main.css
   - Preserve logical grouping (keep related selectors together)
   - Add comment blocks: "/* Synced from talkingheads.com to match layout and styling */"
   - Avoid duplication (skip if selector already exists with identical properties)
   - Resolve conflicts by preferring talkingheads.com styles for visual parity

3. Maintain code quality:
   - Respect existing code style in css/main.css
   - Keep formatting consistent
   - Add clear comments for newly added sections

### Verification Phase
1. Visual comparison:
   - Compare local and remote sites side-by-side
   - Verify header, navigation, hero, content, and footer match
   - Check responsive behavior at different breakpoints

2. Document limitations:
   - Note any differences that cannot be resolved via CSS alone
   - Document missing assets (images, fonts) that affect visual parity
   - List any HTML structure differences that prevent exact matching

## Success Criteria
- Local site (talkingheadstudio.com/index.php) visually matches talkingheads.com
- All above-the-fold elements have matching styling
- Backup file created successfully
- No existing functionality broken
- CSS changes are well-documented with comments

## Constraints
- Do not remove existing styles unless they clearly conflict
- Do not modify HTML structure unless explicitly approved
- Only modify css/main.css (and create backup)
- Do not introduce new frameworks or libraries
- Maintain existing code style and formatting

## Deliverables
1. Backup file: css/main.backup.before-talkingheads-sync.css
2. Updated css/main.css with all missing CSS from talkingheads.com
3. Documentation of changes made
4. List of any remaining visual differences and their causes
