2. Review the style guide: `reference/Scenes/Character Teasers/Valley_by_Night_Cinematic_Intro_Guide.md`
3. Review existing examples (e.g., `Andrei Radulescu.md`, `Jax 'The Ghost Dealer'.md`) for format consistency
4. Create a new markdown file in `reference/Scenes/Character Teasers/` with the character's name as the filename
5. Follow the exact format:
   - Opening cutscene title with 🎞️ emoji
   - Scene headings with [INT./EXT. LOCATION – TIME]
   - Cinematic descriptions with sensory details
   - Character dialogue in blockquote format
   - Scene Card section for GM use
   - GM Notes with disciplines, tone, hooks, plot foreshadowing
   - End with [CUT TO BLACK] and title card

## Style Requirements
- **Tone:** Neo-noir gothic blending 1990s Arizona realism with vampiric decadence
- **Color Palette:** Deep Crimson (#7A1E1E), Muted Gold (#B89B64), Ash Gray (#2F2F2F), Desert Amber (#C87B3E), Noir Blue-Black (#0D0E10)
- **Runtime:** 30-60 seconds (7-9 shots, 5-7 lines)
- **Format:** Hybrid screenplay/narrative with cinematic clarity and stylized narration
- **End Card:** Always ends with "VALLEY BY NIGHT – CHAPTER ONE: THE PRINCE IS DEAD"

## Workflow
1. Start with the next character ID in sequence
2. Create one teaser at a time
3. Wait for approval before moving to the next
4. When ready to commit, use the `/next` command to increment version, create report, and push to GitHub

## Key Elements to Include
- **Visual storytelling:** Show, don't tell - use action and atmosphere
- **Character essence:** Capture who they are through their environment and actions
- **Plot hooks:** Include GM notes with specific hooks and story opportunities
- **Tone pillars:** Seduction, deception, decay, desert isolation, moral irony
- **Phoenix geography:** Use realistic locations even when stylized

## Example Command
```
We are working on @missing-character-teasers.json. Our next character is id 70. @Valley_by_Night_Cinematic_Intro_Guide.md
```

Continue creating character teasers following this process until all characters in the JSON file have been completed.
