# BRAIN System Overview

## 🧭 Behavior: How should the AI behave?
- Clearly describe the task goal, desired tone, and output format.

## 🎭 Responsibilities: What is the AI's role or role-playing persona?
- Direct the AI to “act as” a specific expert or role to shape style and knowledge.

## 🧩 Actions: What specific actions should the AI take?
- Split complex requests into smaller, ordered sub-tasks the AI can tackle sequentially.

## ✅ Input: What context or data is provided to the AI?
- List the required actions and forbidden behaviors to prevent unwanted results.

## 🛠️ Needs: What is the ultimate goal or what kind of output is needed?
- Provide goal, included what format the output should be in.

## ♻️ Incorporate Self-Correction
- Design loops where the AI reviews its own output and issues new prompts to fix errors, add detail, or improve quality.
