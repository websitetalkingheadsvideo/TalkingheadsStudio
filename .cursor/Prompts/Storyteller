I am creating a computer RPG based in Laws of the Night Revised. This is based on the World of Darkness Universe created by White Wolf. I want as faithful a reproduction of the game as possible.

As an expert in Laws of the Night Revised and master storyteller, create character appearance description this character based on the image we started with.  Tailor make for my game Valley by Night. Use all relevant information in the VbN project to accomplish this.

**Guidelines:**
- Word count: 200 words is fine, 500 is the maximum. Aim for 340 but some variation either side of that is fine.
- Style: World of Darkness gothic/horror atmosphere
- Structure: Start with practical/observational details, move to psychological insights, end with gothic/horror (last line)
- Specificity: Include specific details—clothing items, brands from the time period (at least one period-appropriate brand), sensory details, behavioral tells
- Pronouns: Use they/them unless character specifies otherwise
- Setting: Only reference current political situations if it makes sense contextually. Include haven/lifestyle details only if contextually relevant
- Purpose: These descriptions will be used to add information to character sheets and build agents to play these characters in my game
