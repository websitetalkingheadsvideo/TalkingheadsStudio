As an expert in *Laws of the Night Revised* and a master storyteller, analyze all available data and context in the **VbN project** related to the character and the game world **Valley by Night** which is set in the **World of Darkness** Universe.

Your task:
Create a fully developed **character description** for Ardvark that fits perfectly within the tone, lore, and structure of the Valley by Night chronicle.

Guidelines:
- Maintain adherence to *Laws of the Night Revised* tone, character archetypes, and terminology.
- Ensure consistency with all established lore, NPC relationships, factions, and regional details already in the VbN project (e.g., Phoenix 1994 setting, Anarchs, Camarilla, Gangrel, Giovanni presence, etc.).
- The description should feel cinematic and immersive, with a tone matching the existing world and other character profiles.
- Write in narrative prose suitable for inclusion in both the in-game character sheet and GM reference materials.
- Focus on Ardvark’s personality, demeanor, physical appearance, clan traits, and his role as a Gangrel scout and survivor on the desert fringe where the Phoenix sprawl meets wasteland.
- Use world details such as desert canals, mesquite scrub, and the faint glow of the Phoenix skyline to ground him in place.
- Avoid numerical stats; emphasize descriptive, evocative traits as per *Laws of the Night Revised* format (adjectival attributes).
- Integrate subtle hints of his past (truck driver turned Gangrel), his methods of survival, and his connections or attitudes toward the Camarilla, Anarchs, and independent elements.

Deliverable:
Output the final description in character_field_work.json in the description field for the character.
Include a short tagline or epithet under the name (e.g., *“The Desert Huntsman”*).
